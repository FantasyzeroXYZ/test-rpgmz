# This file tells GitHub Pages not to process the site with Jekyll

# Why this file exists:
# 1. GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default to build static sites
# 2. Jekyll ignores files and directories that start with underscores (_)
# 3. Many web projects have folders like _next, _build, _dist, etc.
# 4. This file disables Jekyll processing, allowing all files to be served

# Benefits for RPGMZ Player:
# - Ensures Service Worker (sw.js) works correctly
# - Allows any file structure from ZIP uploads to work
# - Prevents issues with underscore-prefixed game assets
# - Better compatibility with JavaScript applications

# This is an empty file - its presence alone disables Jekyll
